<p>REFLECTION DESIGN THINKING
  a.Summary of Gained Insights from Design Thinking:
   - Design Thinking is a problem-solving approach that focuses on understanding and addressing user needs in a creative and iterative manner.
   - The process involves five phases: empathy, define, ideate, prototype, and testing, with a continuous loop for adjustments based on testing outcomes.
   - The application of Design Thinking in the context of Privacy, Security, and Ethics in finance tools involved conducting a survey to identify issues and developing a financial application prototype, "SafeStash," addressing identified problems.

b. Suggestions for Improvement:
   - Despite successful collaboration, challenges arose from disparate schedules, leading to a shift to digital platforms. Strategies for smoother coordination during scheduling conflicts could be explored.
   - The data collection challenge due to time constraints could be mitigated by better planning and allocation of resources, ensuring a more comprehensive survey response.

c. Other Reflections and Ideas:
   - The team's ability to adapt to unforeseen circumstances, such as using Google Meet for discussions, showcases resilience and flexibility, valuable skills in any collaborative project.
   - The emphasis on continuous learning and staying updated on industry trends is crucial for aspiring software engineers, aligning with the dynamic nature of technology.
   - The detailed categorization in the survey, incorporating various perspectives within the computer science student demographic, demonstrates a thoughtful and inclusive approach to data collection.
   - The proposed features in the financial application prototype, like Two-Factor Authentication and Incognito Mode, show a forward-thinking mindset in balancing user privacy and usability.
   - Individual reflections highlight personal goals, ranging from mastering programming languages to addressing complex issues in software engineering, emphasizing the importance of a holistic approach to career development.
   - The inclusion of diverse perspectives within the team, each contributing unique insights, reflects the strength of collaboration in fostering creative problem-solving.

Overall, the application of Design Thinking not only led to a tangible solution but also enhanced various skills such as adaptability, creativity, and problem-solving, contributing to the overall growth of the team members in their pursuit of successful software engineering careers.</p>
